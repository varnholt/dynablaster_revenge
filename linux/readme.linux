Running the game

   In order to run the game on Linux you must have the following libraries 
   installed on your system:   
   
      - Qt >= 4.8.0
         libqt4-core
         libqt4-gui
         libqt4-opengl
         libqt4-network
         
      - SDL >= 2.0.2
         libsdl2
      
      - ALSA >= 2.0
         libasound2

   On apt-based systems you can install all these packages as follows:  
   
      sudo apt-get install libqt4-core libqt4-gui libqt4-opengl libqt4-network
      sudo apt-get install libsdl2
      sudo apt-get install libasound2    


   In case there's no SDL 2.0.2 or greater available for your distribution, you 
   can just compile your own:
    
      wget http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.3.tar.gz
      tar xzf SDL2-2.0.3.tar.gz
      cd SDL2-2.0.3
      ./configure
      make
      sudo make install 

      
   Moreover, you should ensure the game binaries are still executable after
   extracting them; for example by calling 'chmod +x dynablaster_linux_x64'. 

   
   
Running the server

   If you like to host a server you can pick between server_linux_x86 and 
   server_linux_x64. 
   Moreover, you might want to use the script like the one below which 
   automatically restarts whenever the server process is killed.
   
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      while true
      do
         if pgrep server[y] 1>/dev/null; then 
            sleep 1
         else
            ./server_linux_x64
         fi
      done
   
   If a window manager is detected a GUI will be shown; otherwise the server
   will run in your console.
   
   
   
Troubleshooting

   - On one system we noticed some performance issues which were resolved by
     disabling vsync. You can do that by editing data/game.ini; there's a
     section 'video' with an entry named 'vsync'. You may set its value
     to 'false'.
   
   - In case you have any dependency issues, it is always a good idea to export 
     the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to "." and copy all required libs to the current
     directory.
